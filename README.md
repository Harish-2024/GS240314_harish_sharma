## Introduction
This is a web application built using React with Vite, leveraging TypeScript, Ant Design, React Router DOM, AG Grid, AG React Charts, Redux Toolkit, and xlsx for reading data from provided xslx sheet. The project demonstrates proficiency in frontend development with a focus on performance, usability, and scalability.

## Getting Started
To set up the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
npm install  # or yarn install
```

## Running the Application
To start the development server:
```sh
npm run dev  # or yarn dev
```
This will start the Vite development server and provide a local URL to access the application.

## Key Implementations
### Features Demonstrating Proficiency
1. **AG Grid & AG React Charts Integration:**
   - Efficiently implemented AG Grid for tabular data with sorting, filtering, and pagination.
   - Integrated AG React Charts to visualize data dynamically.
   - These demonstrate expertise in working with powerful third-party libraries to enhance user experience.

2. **State Management with Redux Toolkit:**
   - Implemented Redux Toolkit for state management, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
   - Used async thunks for efficient API handling.
   - Demonstrates a strong understanding of modern state management practices.

3. **Routing with React Router DOM:**
   - Implemented client-side routing for seamless navigation.
   - Shows proficiency in structuring SPAs effectively.

4. **Excel (XLSX) Support:**
   - Integrated `xlsx` to handle data export/import in Excel format.
   - This showcases the ability to work with data-heavy applications efficiently.

## Potential Improvements
If I had 4 more hours, I would:
1. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Implement lazy loading for routes and heavy components.
   - Optimize AG Grid rendering with efficient row updates.

2. **Improve UI/UX:**
   - Add loading indicators and skeleton loaders for better user experience.
   - Fine-tune Ant Design components for better responsiveness.

3. **Refactor & Improve Code Readability:**
   - Improve TypeScript typings and modularize code for better maintainability.
